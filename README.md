# Upcomer

Upcomer is a university study platform organized around courses. This Sprint 1 slice lets students open a course, browse its previous exams and materials, and view original uploaded files. Authentication, discovery, uploads, and admin screens belong to other team members.

## Stack and requirements

Next.js App Router, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, PostgreSQL, Prisma, Vitest, React Testing Library, and Playwright. Use Node.js 20.9 or newer and a running PostgreSQL server.

## Local setup

1. Run `npm install`.
2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`. Set `DATABASE_URL` to a PostgreSQL database and `FILE_STORAGE_ROOT` to the folder containing uploaded files. The sample value `public/uploads` works for the committed fixtures.
3. Run `npm run db:migrate` to apply the initial schema.
4. Run `npm run db:seed` to add three courses and their sample resources.
5. Run `npm run dev` and open `http://localhost:3000/courses/course-eece350`.

The seed is repeatable and includes one record for a deliberately missing physical file (`file-missing`) to exercise failure handling. The six PDF fixtures live in `public/uploads`. The home route is only a placeholder for Member 2's discovery interface.

## Commands

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `npm run dev` | Development server |
| `npm run build` | Production build |
| `npm run lint` | ESLint |
| `npm test` | Unit and component tests |
| `npm run test:e2e` | Playwright flow; requires migrated and seeded database |
| `npm run db:migrate` | Apply/create Prisma migrations |
| `npm run db:seed` | Seed local data |

## Routes

| Route | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `/courses/:courseId` | Course home |
| `/courses/:courseId/exams` | Exams for that course |
| `/courses/:courseId/materials` | Materials for that course |
| `/files/:fileId` | Original bytes for a stored file record |

## Team integration

Member 2 can link any `Course.id` to `/courses/:courseId` and reuse `Course`, `Faculty`, and `Professor`. Member 4 can manage those shared models and `CourseFile` metadata. Member 5 can create a `CourseFile` with a course ID, category, and storage key relative to `FILE_STORAGE_ROOT`; the resource appears on the appropriate page automatically. File links accept an ID only, never a filesystem path.

The file route shows PDFs in the browser and downloads other file types. It rejects keys that escape the upload folder, including through filesystem links.
