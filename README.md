# Upcomer

Upcomer is a university study platform organized around courses. This Sprint 1 slice lets students open a course, browse its previous exams and materials, and view original uploaded files. Authentication, discovery, uploads, and admin screens belong to other team members.

## Stack and requirements

Next.js App Router, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, PostgreSQL, Prisma, Vitest, React Testing Library, and Playwright. Use Node.js 20.9 or newer and a running PostgreSQL server.

## Local setup

1. Run `npm install`.
2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`. Set `DATABASE_URL` to a PostgreSQL database and `FILE_STORAGE_ROOT` to the folder containing uploaded files. The sample value `public/uploads` works for the committed fixtures.
3. Run `npm run db:migrate` to apply the initial schema.
4. Run `npm run db:seed` to add three courses and their sample resources.
5. Run `npm run dev` and open `http://localhost:3000/courses/course-eece350`.

The seed is repeatable and includes one record for a deliberately missing physical file (`file-missing`) to exercise failure handling. The six PDF fixtures live in `public/uploads`. The home route is only a placeholder for Member 2's discovery interface.

## Commands

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `npm run dev` | Development server |
| `npm run build` | Production build |
| `npm run lint` | ESLint |
| `npm test` | Unit and component tests |
| `npm run test:e2e` | Playwright flow; requires migrated and seeded database |
| `npm run db:migrate` | Apply/create Prisma migrations |
| `npm run db:seed` | Seed local data |

## Routes

| Route | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `/courses/:courseId` | Course home |
| `/courses/:courseId/exams` | Exams for that course |
| `/courses/:courseId/materials` | Materials for that course |
| `/files/:fileId` | Original bytes for a stored file record |
| `/admin/uploads` | Admin upload menu |
| `/admin/uploads/exams` | Upload a previous exam; optional `courseId` query parameter preselects the course |
| `/admin/uploads/materials` | Upload a course material; optional `courseId` query parameter preselects the course |
| `POST /api/admin/uploads` | Stores an uploaded file and creates its `CourseFile` record |

## Team integration

Member 2 can link any `Course.id` to `/courses/:courseId` and reuse `Course`, `Faculty`, and `Professor`. Member 4 can manage those shared models and `CourseFile` metadata. Member 5 can create a `CourseFile` with a course ID, category, and storage key relative to `FILE_STORAGE_ROOT`; the resource appears on the appropriate page automatically. File links accept an ID only, never a filesystem path.

The file route shows PDFs in the browser and downloads other file types. It rejects keys that escape the upload folder, including through filesystem links.

## Content ingestion (Member 5)

The admin upload pages cover US-70 (upload a previous exam) and US-71 (upload course materials). Each form takes a course, a title, a file, and optional professor, year, session (exams only), and topic. A finished upload appears on the course's exams or materials page immediately and opens through `/files/:fileId`.

- **Accepted files** are PDF, DOCX, PPTX, PNG, and JPG up to 20 MB. The type is decided from the extension and checked against the file's leading bytes, so an empty, corrupt, or renamed file is refused with a message. The MIME type sent by the browser is ignored.
- **Storage** writes each file under `FILE_STORAGE_ROOT` as `exams/<uuid>.<ext>` or `materials/<uuid>.<ext>`. The original name is kept only in `CourseFile.originalFileName`. If the database record cannot be created, the stored file is removed again.
- **`POST /api/admin/uploads`** takes `multipart/form-data` with `category` (`EXAM` or `MATERIAL`), `courseId`, `title`, `file`, and optional `professorId`, `year`, `session`, `topic`. It answers `201` with `{ file: { id, title, category, courseId, url } }`, or `{ reason, error }` with `400` (invalid fields, empty or corrupt file, unknown professor), `404` (unknown course), `413` (too large), `415` (unsupported type), or `500` (storage or database failure).

The service is in `lib/uploads.ts` (`validateUploadFile`, `parseUploadForm`, `saveUpload`, `getUploadOptions`), the limits shared with the browser are in `lib/upload-rules.ts`, and the form is `components/upload-form.tsx`.

Failures are logged with `logError` as `upload_rejected` (with the reason), `upload_storage_failed`, `upload_record_failed`, `upload_cleanup_failed`, `upload_failed`, and `upload_options_retrieval_failed`. Logs carry the course ID and category, never the file name, title, or contents.

The upload pages and endpoint are **not access-controlled yet**: this branch has no authentication. They must be restricted to admins when Member 1's sessions and Member 4's admin area are merged.

Tests are in `tests/unit/uploads.test.ts`, `tests/unit/upload-route.test.ts`, `tests/unit/upload-pages.test.tsx`, and `tests/e2e/admin-uploads.spec.ts`. Shared files changed: `lib/logger.ts` (the six events above), `app/globals.css` (`.form`, `.form-error`, `.form-success`), and `.gitignore` (uploaded files under `public/uploads/exams` and `public/uploads/materials`).
