# Upcomer

Upcomer is a university study platform organized around courses. This Sprint 1 slice lets a student create an account, log in, discover a course, add it to My Courses, open the course, browse its previous exams and materials, and view original uploaded files. Uploads and admin screens belong to other team members.

## Stack and requirements

Next.js App Router, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, PostgreSQL, Prisma, Vitest, React Testing Library, and Playwright. Use Node.js 20.9 or newer and a running PostgreSQL server.

## Local setup

1. Run `npm install`.
2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`. Set `DATABASE_URL` to a PostgreSQL database and `FILE_STORAGE_ROOT` to the folder containing uploaded files. The sample value `public/uploads` works for the committed fixtures. Set `ADMIN_EMAIL` and `ADMIN_PASSWORD` to seed an admin user, and `SIGNUP_EMAIL_DOMAIN` if sign-up should accept one email domain only.
3. Run `npm run db:migrate` to apply the initial schema.
4. Run `npm run db:seed` to add three courses and their sample resources.
5. Run `npm run dev` and open `http://localhost:3000/courses/course-eece350`.

The seed is repeatable and includes one record for a deliberately missing physical file (`file-missing`) to exercise failure handling. The six PDF fixtures live in `public/uploads`. The home route is only a placeholder for Member 2's discovery interface.

## Team integration

Member 2 can link any `Course.id` to `/courses/:courseId` and reuse `Course`, `Faculty`, and `Professor`. Member 4 can manage those shared models and `CourseFile` metadata. Member 5 can create a `CourseFile` with a course ID, category, and storage key relative to `FILE_STORAGE_ROOT`; the resource appears on the appropriate page automatically. File links accept an ID only, never a filesystem path.

The file route shows PDFs in the browser and downloads other file types. It rejects keys that escape the upload folder, including through filesystem links.

## Content ingestion (Member 5)

The admin upload pages cover US-70 (upload a previous exam) and US-71 (upload course materials). Each form takes a course, a title, a file, and optional professor, year, term, type (exams only), and topic. The metadata fields and their checks are shared with Member 4's file edit page (US-72). A finished upload appears on the course's exams or materials page immediately and opens through `/files/:fileId`.

- **Accepted files** are PDF, DOCX, PPTX, PNG, and JPG up to 20 MB. The type is decided from the extension and checked against the file's leading bytes, so an empty, corrupt, or renamed file is refused with a message. The MIME type sent by the browser is ignored.
- **Storage** writes each file under `FILE_STORAGE_ROOT` as `exams/<uuid>.<ext>` or `materials/<uuid>.<ext>`. The original name is kept only in `CourseFile.originalFileName`. If the database record cannot be created, the stored file is removed again.
- **`POST /api/admin/uploads`** takes `multipart/form-data` with `category` (`EXAM` or `MATERIAL`), `courseId`, `title`, `file`, and optional `professorId`, `year`, `termId`, `examType` (`MIDTERM`, `FINAL`, `QUIZ`, or `OTHER`; exams only), `topic`. It answers `201` with `{ file: { id, title, category, courseId, url } }`, or `{ reason, error }` with `400` (invalid fields, empty or corrupt file, `course_required`, `invalid_year`, `topic_too_long`, `professor_not_assigned`, `term_not_found`, `invalid_type`, `type_not_allowed`), `404` (unknown course), `413` (too large), `415` (unsupported type), or `500` (storage or database failure).

The service is in `lib/uploads.ts` (`validateUploadFile`, `parseUploadForm`, `saveUpload`, `getUploadOptions`), the limits shared with the browser are in `lib/upload-rules.ts`, and the form is `components/upload-form.tsx`.

Failures are logged with `logError` as `upload_rejected` (with the reason), `upload_storage_failed`, `upload_record_failed`, `upload_cleanup_failed`, `upload_failed`, and `upload_options_retrieval_failed`. Logs carry the course ID and category, never the file name, title, or contents.

The upload pages and endpoint are **admin-only** (fixed in `fix/admin-upload-auth`). Each `/admin/uploads` page calls `requireAdmin()`, so a student gets the not-found page and a visitor is sent to log in. `POST /api/admin/uploads` calls `getAdminUser()` before reading the body and answers `403` (`forbidden`) to anyone else.

Tests are in `tests/unit/uploads.test.ts`, `tests/unit/upload-route.test.ts`, `tests/unit/upload-pages.test.tsx`, and `tests/e2e/admin-uploads.spec.ts`. The e2e spec deletes the records and stored files it uploads when it finishes. Shared files changed: `lib/logger.ts` (the six events above), `app/globals.css` (`.form`, `.form-error`, `.form-success`), and `.gitignore` (uploaded files under `public/uploads/exams` and `public/uploads/materials`).
## Course discovery (Member 2)

The home route `/` covers US-05 (browse courses) and US-06 (search and filter courses). It lists every course with its code, name, faculty, and professors, 20 per page, and each course links to `/courses/:courseId`. An empty catalog shows "No courses are available yet."

- **Search (`q`)** matches course code or name, ignoring case. Codes also match with spaces removed, so `eece 350` finds `EECE350`. An exact code match is listed first.
- **Filters (`facultyId`, `professorId`)** come from dropdowns and combine with the search. A search or filter with no match shows "No courses found." An ID that no longer exists, for example from an old link, also shows a short message saying the selected faculty or professor doesn't exist.
- **Pagination (`page`)** keeps the search and filters. Invalid or out-of-range pages fall back to the first or last page.

The data functions are in `lib/catalog.ts` (`getCatalogCourses`, `getCatalogFilterOptions`, `rankCourses`, `paginateCourses`), and the list component is `components/course-list.tsx`. Courses and faculties managed by Member 4 appear in the catalog and dropdowns automatically.

Failures are logged with `logError` as `course_catalog_retrieval_failed`, `course_search_failed` (with the filter IDs, never the search text), and `catalog_filter_options_retrieval_failed`, then shown through the generic error page.

Tests are in `tests/unit/catalog.test.ts`, `tests/unit/catalog-page.test.tsx`, `tests/unit/course-list.test.tsx`, and `tests/e2e/course-discovery.spec.ts`. Shared files changed: `lib/logger.ts` (the three events above), `app/globals.css` (`.search` and `.pagination`), and `app/page.tsx` (replaced the placeholder).

## Authentication and My Courses (Member 1)

`/signup`, `/login`, and `/my-courses` cover US-01 (create an account), US-02 (log in and log out), and US-07 (add a course to My Courses). Sessions are rows in the database, not JWTs, so logging out really revokes the session.

- **Sign-up** needs a name, a valid email, and a password of at least `PASSWORD_MIN_LENGTH` (8) characters. Emails are normalized with `trim().toLowerCase()`, so `Ali@…` and `ali@…` are one account. A second sign-up with the same email says the account already exists. Setting `SIGNUP_EMAIL_DOMAIN` (for example `@mail.aub.edu`) restricts sign-up to one domain. A new account is sent to `/login`, not logged in automatically.
- **Login** always answers "Invalid email or password," whether the email is unknown or the password is wrong, so nobody can test which emails are registered. Passwords are bcrypt hashes (cost 10).
- **Sessions** store only the SHA-256 hash of a 32-byte random token; the raw token lives in an `httpOnly`, `SameSite=Lax`, 7-day cookie, marked `Secure` in production. Logging out deletes the row and the cookie, and logout is a `POST` form so a prefetch or an image tag cannot end a session.
- **Access** is enforced in the data layer with `requireUser()`, `requireAdmin()`, and `getAdminUser()` from `lib/auth.ts`, called inside pages, server actions, and route handlers. `middleware.ts` only redirects a request without a session cookie to `/login?next=…`, because middleware-only authentication has been bypassed before (CVE-2025-29927). Browsing and course pages stay open to visitors; `/my-courses` and `/admin/*` need a session.
- **`next` redirects** accept relative paths only, so a crafted login link cannot send a student to another site.
- **My Courses** uses a composite primary key `@@id([userId, courseId])`, so a duplicate is impossible in the database; the second of two racing clicks fails with Prisma `P2002` and is reported as "Already in My Courses." Adding an unknown course ID returns 404.

Data functions live in `lib/auth.ts` and `lib/my-courses.ts`, server actions in `lib/auth-actions.ts` and `lib/my-courses-actions.ts`, and the shared cookie constants and `safeNext` in `lib/session-cookie.ts` so `middleware.ts` stays free of Node-only imports.

Failures are logged with `logError` as `signup_failed`, `login_failed`, `session_validation_failed`, `logout_failed`, `unauthorized_access`, `my_courses_add_failed`, and `my_courses_retrieval_failed`. Only IDs, roles, routes, reasons, and error types are logged, never an email, password, or session token.

Tests are in `tests/unit/auth.test.ts`, `tests/unit/auth-actions.test.ts`, `tests/unit/my-courses.test.ts`, `tests/unit/auth-pages.test.tsx`, `tests/unit/add-to-my-courses.test.tsx`, `tests/unit/middleware.test.ts`, and `tests/e2e/auth-my-courses.spec.ts`.

## Catalog management (Member 4)

`/admin/catalog` covers US-69 (manage the course catalog). Admins add and edit faculties, courses, professors, and terms, and assign professors to courses. Every change shows in the catalog at `/` and its filters straight away. Entries cannot be deleted yet. The header shows an "Admin" link to admins only.

- **Access.** Every page and server action calls `requireAdmin()` first. A student gets the not-found page, and a visitor is sent to `/login?next=…`.
- **Course and faculty codes** are stored without spaces and in capitals, so `eece 350` is saved as `EECE350` and refused if that code exists, matching Member 2's search. A code is 2 to 20 letters or digits. The duplicate check gives the message, and the unique index refuses a racing second save (`P2002`), which shows the same message.
- **Terms** (`Term`, added in `20261005000000_catalog_terms`) are a list of names such as Fall, Spring, and Summer, seeded by `npm run db:seed`. Names are unique ignoring case. Files link to a term (US-72).
- **Professors** have no uniqueness rule, since two professors can share a name. A course's professors are set together with the course in one transaction.

The service is `lib/catalog-admin.ts`, the server actions are `lib/catalog-admin-actions.ts`, and the pages are under `app/admin/catalog/`, with `components/catalog-notice.tsx` and `components/course-fields.tsx`.

Failures are logged with `logError` as `catalog_entry_rejected` (with the entity and reason: `invalid_fields`, `duplicate_code`, `duplicate_name`, `not_found`, `unknown_faculty`, or `unknown_professor`), `catalog_entry_save_failed` (entity, `create` or `update`, entry ID, error type), and `catalog_admin_retrieval_failed`. Codes and names typed by admins are never logged.

### File metadata (US-72)

`/admin/files` lists every file, filterable by course, and `/admin/files/:id` sets a file's course, professor, year, term, type, and topic. The catalog overview links to it.

- **Fields.** `CourseFile.session` (free text) is replaced by `termId` (a link to `Term`) and `examType` (`MIDTERM`, `FINAL`, `QUIZ`, `OTHER`), in migration `20261006000000_file_metadata`. The migration moved existing values into the term or type. Any text that was not exactly a term name or a type word is kept in the topic.
- **Rules**, the same for the edit page and the upload form (`lib/file-metadata-rules.ts`, `lib/file-metadata.ts`):
  - The course is required and must exist.
  - The professor is optional but must teach that course.
  - The term is optional but must exist.
  - The year is optional, 4 digits, from 1950 to next year.
  - The topic is at most 100 characters.
  - A type is allowed on exams only.
- **Retagging.** Changing the course moves the file to the new course's pages straight away. The professor list follows the chosen course.

Failures are logged as `file_metadata_rejected` (file ID and reason), `file_metadata_save_failed` (file ID and error type), and `file_metadata_retrieval_failed`. Titles and topics are never logged.

Tests are in `tests/unit/catalog-admin.test.ts`, `tests/unit/catalog-admin-actions.test.ts`, `tests/unit/catalog-admin-pages.test.tsx`, `tests/unit/file-metadata.test.ts`, `tests/unit/file-metadata-actions.test.ts`, `tests/unit/file-metadata-pages.test.tsx`, `tests/e2e/admin-catalog.spec.ts`, and `tests/e2e/admin-file-metadata.spec.ts`. Admin e2e tests log in through `tests/e2e/fixtures.ts`, which reads `ADMIN_EMAIL` and `ADMIN_PASSWORD` from `.env`. Shared files changed: `prisma/schema.prisma` and `prisma/seed.ts` (terms), `lib/logger.ts` (the three events above), `app/layout.tsx` (the Admin link), and `app/globals.css` (`.field select`, `.checkbox-list`, `.catalog-list`, `.catalog-links`).
